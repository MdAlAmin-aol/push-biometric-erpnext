### Note on setting up local config
- You need to make a copy of `local_config.py.template` file and rename it to `local_config.py`
- Please fill in the relevant sections in this file as per the comments in it.
- Below are the delineation of the keys contained in `local_config.py`:
  - ERPNext Connection Configs:
    - `ERPNEXT_API_KEY`: The API Key of the ERPNext User
    - `ERPNEXT_API_SECRET`: The API Secret of the ERPNext User
      > Please refer to [this link](https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/guides/integration/how_to_set_up_token_based_auth#generate-a-token) to learn how to generate API key and secret for a user in ERPNext. 

      > The ERPNext User who's API key and secret is used, needs to have the following permissions: 

      > 1. Create Permissions for 'Employee Checkin' DocType.

      > 2. Write Permissions for 'Shift Type' DocType.
    - `ERPNEXT_URL`: The web address at which you would access your ERPNext. eg:`'https://yourcompany.erpnext.com'`, `'https://erp.yourcompany.com'`
> TODO: fill this section with more info to help Non-Technical Individuals.

#### Other TODO:
 - Write a setup/auto-install script and ask questions to fill-in/update the `local_config.py` file.
 - Write a dev note on how stuff works in the `push_to_erpnext.py` script?
